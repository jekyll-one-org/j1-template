How to disable captions (subtitles) on a youtube video using the
Player API used for iframe Embeds?

Unfortunately, there isn't a direct way to disable captions using the
YouTube Player API.

The Player API provides control over various aspects of the video player,
but it doesn't offer granular control over caption visibility. This is likely
because YouTube aims to provide an inclusive experience for all users,
including those who rely on captions for accessibility.

However, you can explore these indirect approaches:

cc_load_policy:
    This parameter can be used to control the initial visibility of captions.
    However, it doesn't completely disable them. It only determines whether
    captions are shown by default.
    Users can still manually enable or disable them.

Here's an example of how to embed a YouTube video with the cc_load_policy
parameter set to 0, which means captions are initially hidden:

HTML
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID?cc_load_policy=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> 1  Â
