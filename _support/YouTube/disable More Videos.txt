Understanding the Challenge

When you pause a YouTube video embedded on a webpage, a "More Videos" section
often appears below the video player. This can be visually distracting,
especially if you don't want users to be redirected to other videos.

While there isn't a direct API to disable the "More Videos" section, we can
leverage JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and CSS to achieve the desired
effect.

Identify the "More Videos" Element:

Use browser developer tools to inspect the HTML structure of the YouTube
player when paused. Look for a specific class or ID that uniquely identifies
the "More Videos" section.

Once you've identified the element, you can use JavaScript to set its display
style to none (Hide the Element).

JavaScript
const moreVideosElement = document.getElementById('more-videos-id');
if (moreVideosElement) {
    moreVideosElement.style.display = 'none';
}


Example: Using YouTube's Player API

If you're using YouTube's Player API to embed the video, you can combine
it with the DOM manipulation technique:

JavaScript
// Assuming you've already initialized the player
player.addEventListener('pause', function() {
  const moreVideosElement = document.getElementById('more-videos-id');
  if (moreVideosElement) {
      moreVideosElement.style.display = 'none';
  }
});
