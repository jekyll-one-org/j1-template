How to make ALL SwiperJS slides the same height?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To make SwiperJS slides the same height, you can use the autoHeight option,
but it’s typically for adjusting the height based on the content inside the
slides.

If you want to force all slides to have the same height regardless of their
content, you can achieve this by setting a specific height for the slides
using CSS.

Here’s how you can do it:

Option 1: Using CSS to Set Equal Height

You can explicitly set the height of each slide by applying CSS to ensure all 
lides maintain the same height.

css

.swiper-slide {
  height: 300px; /* Adjust this value as per your requirement */
}

Option 2: Using Swiper’s setWrapperSize method (if needed dynamically)

In case the height needs to be set dynamically based on some JavaScript logic,
you can use the setWrapperSize method after Swiper initializes, though it’s
not commonly necessary if you’re just setting a static height.

js

const swiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
  // other options here
  on: {
    init: function () {
      // Set a specific height here if necessary, for instance
      let slideHeight = 300;  // Your desired height
      swiper.slides.forEach(slide => {
        slide.style.height = `${slideHeight}px`;
      });
    }
  }
});

But generally, setting the height through CSS is the most straightforward way.

Option 3: Use autoHeight with Dynamic Content

If your slides have varying content but you want them to be the same
height based on the tallest slide, Swiper’s autoHeight can help adjust
it dynamically.

js

const swiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
  autoHeight: true,  // This will automatically adjust the height based on content
  // other options...
});

However, note that autoHeight can make slides taller to fit the content of
the tallest slide. If all you need is fixed equal height, option 1 or 2
should be the way to go.
