How to add a property like "display: none" to an already existing class
"vjs-remaining-time" in JavaScript?

You can add the `display: none;` style to an already existing class
`vjs-remaining-time` in JavaScript using several methods. Here are a few
common approaches:

**1. Using `document.querySelector` and `style.display` (Recommended for direct manipulation):**

This is often the most straightforward way if you want to directly
manipulate the style of an element.

```javascript
// Get the element(s) with the class 'vjs-remaining-time'
const remainingTimeElements = document.querySelectorAll('.vjs-remaining-time');

// Iterate through them if there could be multiple, or just select the first if you know there's only one.
remainingTimeElements.forEach(element => {
    element.style.display = 'none';
});

// If you are absolutely certain there's only one element with that class and you want to target the first one found:
// const remainingTimeElement = document.querySelector('.vjs-remaining-time');
// if (remainingTimeElement) {
//     remainingTimeElement.style.display = 'none';
// }
```

**Explanation:**

* `document.querySelectorAll('.vjs-remaining-time')`: This selects all elements that have the class `vjs-remaining-time`. It returns a NodeList, so you might need to iterate if there are multiple.
* `element.style.display = 'none';`: This directly sets the `display` CSS property of the selected element to `none`.

**2. Adding a new CSS class that has `display: none`:**

This is a good approach if you want to toggle the visibility or manage this state with a separate CSS class.

**First, in your CSS (or in a `<style>` block in your HTML):**

```css
.hide-time {
    display: none !important; /* Use !important if you need to override existing styles */
}
```

**Then, in your JavaScript:**

```javascript
const remainingTimeElements = document.querySelectorAll('.vjs-remaining-time');

remainingTimeElements.forEach(element => {
    element.classList.add('hide-time');
});
```

**Explanation:**

* `element.classList.add('hide-time')`: This adds the `hide-time` class to the element. Since `hide-time` has `display: none`, the element will become hidden.
* `!important`: This is optional but can be useful if the existing `vjs-remaining-time` class or other styles are overriding your `display: none`. Use it carefully, as it can make debugging CSS harder.

**3. Toggling the visibility (if you want to show/hide later):**

If you anticipate needing to show the element again, `classList.toggle` or simply setting `display` to an empty string (or its original value) is useful.

```javascript
const remainingTimeElements = document.querySelectorAll('.vjs-remaining-time');

// To hide:
remainingTimeElements.forEach(element => {
    element.style.display = 'none';
});

// To show (assuming it was originally 'block', 'inline', etc. - or just remove the inline style):
// remainingTimeElements.forEach(element => {
//     element.style.display = ''; // Removes the inline 'display' style, letting CSS rules apply
//     // Or: element.style.display = 'block'; // Or 'inline-block', 'flex', etc., depending on its original display type
// });
```

**When to choose which method:**

* **`element.style.display = 'none';`**: Best for direct, immediate manipulation of an element's style, especially if it's a one-off change or you're managing a very specific state.
* **`element.classList.add('your-hide-class');`**: Preferred when you want to abstract the styling into CSS classes, making your JavaScript cleaner and your styles easier to manage and reuse. This is particularly good if you're dealing with multiple states (e.g., hidden, active, disabled).

**Important Considerations for `vjs-remaining-time` (Video.js):**

If you're working with Video.js, keep in mind that Video.js often manipulates the DOM. Directly changing styles might be overridden by Video.js's internal logic, especially if it re-renders parts of its UI.

* **Timing:** Make sure your JavaScript code runs *after* the Video.js player has been initialized and the `vjs-remaining-time` element is present in the DOM. You might need to put your code inside a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener or a Video.js `ready` event.
* **Video.js API (if available):** Check the Video.js documentation for any specific API methods to control the visibility of player controls. Sometimes, a framework provides a more robust way to manage its components.

Here's an example of how you might ensure the code runs after the DOM is ready:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
    const remainingTimeElements = document.querySelectorAll('.vjs-remaining-time');
    remainingTimeElements.forEach(element => {
        element.style.display = 'none';
    });
});
```

Choose the method that best fits your specific needs and coding style. For simply hiding an element, direct `style.display` manipulation is often sufficient.
