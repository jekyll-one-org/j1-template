How to add a property like "display: none" to an already existing class
"vjs-remaining-time" in JavaScript?

In JavaScript, there isn't a direct way to "add a property to an *existing* class"
in the same way you might modify a class definition before it's instantiated.
Once a class is defined, its prototype chain is set. However, there are several
common approaches to achieve what you're likely trying to do, depending on your
specific goal:

**1. Adding a property to instances of the class (the most common scenario):**

If you want every *instance* of `vjs-remaining-time` (or any class) to have
a new property, you'll typically do this when you create or initialize those
instances.

* **During instantiation (if you control the creation):**

If you're creating the `vjs-remaining-time` component yourself, you can pass
in options or directly set properties on the created instance. Video.js
components are often created like this:

    ```javascript
    // Assuming 'vjs-remaining-time' is a Video.js component or similar
    const player = videojs('my-video'); // Your video player instance

    // Example of adding a new property 'myCustomProperty' to an instance
    const remainingTimeDisplay = player.getChild('RemainingTimeDisplay'); // Or however you get the instance

    if (remainingTimeDisplay) {
        remainingTimeDisplay.myCustomProperty = 'This is my custom value';
        console.log(remainingTimeDisplay.myCustomProperty);
    }
    ```

* **By extending the class (for Video.js components):**

For Video.js components, the recommended way to add custom functionality
(including properties and methods) is to extend the base component class.
This allows you to create your own version with the added property and
then register it with Video.js.

    ```javascript
    // Assume videojs is available
    const Component = videojs.getComponent('Component');
    const RemainingTimeDisplay = videojs.getComponent('RemainingTimeDisplay');

    class MyCustomRemainingTime extends RemainingTimeDisplay {
        constructor(player, options) {
            super(player, options);
            // Add your new property here
            this.myNewProperty = 'Hello from custom remaining time!';
        }

        // You can also override methods or add new ones
        updateContent() {
            super.updateContent(); // Call the original method
            console.log(this.myNewProperty); // Access your new property
            // Add more custom logic here
        }
    }

    // Register your new component (if you want to use it instead of the default)
    videojs.registerComponent('MyCustomRemainingTime', MyCustomRemainingTime);

    // To use it, you might need to configure your player or replace the existing component
    // Example: This part depends on how you're setting up your player and components.
    // You might add it as a child component:
    // player.addChild('MyCustomRemainingTime', {});
    // Or override the default 'RemainingTimeDisplay' (more advanced and might require player re-initialization or specific plugin logic).
    ```

**2. Adding a property to the `prototype` of the class (less common for direct manipulation of library classes):**

While technically possible, directly modifying the `prototype` of a
third-party library's class like `vjs-remaining-time` (which is likely
`videojs.getComponent('RemainingTimeDisplay')` or similar) is generally
**not recommended**. It can lead to unpredictable behavior, conflicts with
future library updates, and make your code harder to maintain.

However, for educational purposes or in very specific, controlled 
scenarios with your own classes:

```javascript
class MyClass {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

const instance1 = new MyClass('Instance 1');
console.log(instance1.newProperty); // undefined

// Adding a property to the prototype *after* the class is defined
MyClass.prototype.newProperty = 'This is a new property on the prototype';

const instance2 = new MyClass('Instance 2');
console.log(instance1.newProperty); // "This is a new property on the prototype"
console.log(instance2.newProperty); // "This is a new property on the prototype"
```

**Why it's not recommended for library classes like `vjs-remaining-time`:**

* **Fragility:** Library updates might overwrite your changes or introduce incompatibilities.
* **Maintainability:** It makes your code harder to understand and debug for others (and your future self).
* **Encapsulation:** It breaks the intended encapsulation of the library's components.

**Best Practice for Video.js:**

If you need to add custom data or behavior to a Video.js component, the best approach is:

1.  **Extend the existing component class** (as shown in "By extending the class" above).
2.  **Use Video.js plugins:** If the functionality is more complex or needs to interact with the player lifecycle, create a Video.js plugin. Plugins are designed to add features to the player and its components in a structured way.

To summarize, for `vjs-remaining-time` (assuming it's a Video.js component), **extending the component and adding the property in your custom class's constructor is the recommended and safest approach.** Avoid directly manipulating prototypes of library classes.
