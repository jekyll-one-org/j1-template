Understanding the vjs-hidden Class and Custom Button Disabling in VideoJS v8.
The vjs-hidden class is a CSS class used by VideoJS to hide elements. When a
button is assigned this class, it becomes visually hidden from the user.

This can occur for several reasons:

1. Conditional Visibility

* Player State:
    VideoJS might conditionally show or hide buttons based on the player's
    current state (e.g., playing, paused, ended).

* User Preferences:
    Certain buttons might be hidden or shown based on user preferences
    or settings.

2. Custom Button Configuration

* Incorrect Initialization:
    Ensure that your custom button is correctly initialized and added to
    the player's control bar.

* Missing or Incorrect show() Method:
    If your custom button component doesn't implement the show() method
    correctly, it might remain hidden.

3. CSS Conflicts

Overriding Styles. Check if any custom CSS rules are unintentionally
overriding the visibility of your button.


Troubleshooting Tips:

Inspect the DOM
---------------

Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the DOM and verify if the
vjs-hidden class is indeed present on your custom button. Check the computed
styles to identify any conflicting CSS rules.

Review Custom Button Implementation
-----------------------------------

Ensure that your custom button component extends the Component class and
correctly implements the necessary methods. Verify that the button is added
to the control bar using the addChild() method.

Check Player State and User Preferences
---------------------------------------

Consider the player's current state and any user preferences that might
affect button visibility. You might need to conditionally show/hide the
button based on these factors.

Leverage VideoJS API:

Use the VideoJS API to control the visibility of your custom button. The show() and hide() methods can be used to toggle visibility.
Example:

JavaScript
// Assuming you have a custom button component:
var MyCustomButton = videojs.extend({

    init: function(player, options) {
        videojs.Component.call(this, player, options);
        // ... other initialization logic
    },

    handleClick: function() {
        // Handle button click event
    },

    show: function() {
        this.el().classList.remove('vjs-hidden');
    },

    hide: function() {
        this.el().classList.add('vjs-hidden');
    }

});

// Add the button to the control bar:
player.controlBar.addChild('myCustomButton');


By following these steps and carefully inspecting your code,
you should be able to identify the root cause of the issue and resolve it.

If you can provide more specific details about your custom button
implementation and the VideoJS version you're using, I can offer more
tailored advice.
