The interactive elements of AmplitudeJS have event handlers bound to
them that responds to a touch or click from a user. These elements build
the functionality of the player you are designing. The scoping of these
elements is handled by attributes that define the level of functionality
each element has such as global, playlist, individual song or individual
song in playlist. These are outlined in detail for each element.

==== link:#play-button[#] Play Button

There are 4 different levels for a play button.

. Global Play - Plays the current song whether it's an individual song
or in a playlist
. Playlist Play - Plays the current song in the playlist.
. Song Play - Plays an individual song by itself.
. Plays an individual song in a playlist.

The play button responds to the 'click' event on a desktop or a
'touchstart' event on mobile.

===== link:#global-play-button[#] Global Play Button

The global play button will play the active song whether or not the song
is an individual song or in a playlist. To add a global play button
simply an HTML element with the class `amplitude-play`.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-play"></span>
  
----

===== link:#playlist-play-button[#] Playlist Play Button

The playlist play button will play the active song in the playlist or it
will play the first song in the playlist if the playlist is out of scope
(meaning another playlist was being played or it's the first playlist
being played). To add a playlist play button, add an HTML element with
the class of `amplitude-play` and the attribute
`data-amplitude-playlist="playlist_index"`.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-play" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist_index}"></span>
  
----

===== link:#individual-song-play-button[#] Individual Song Play Button

The individual song play button will play the song defined by the
`data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}"` attribute.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-play" data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}"></span>
  
----

===== link:#individual-song-in-playlist-button[#] Individual Song In Playlist Button

The individual playlist button is a combination of the attributes
`data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}"` and
`data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist}"`. This will play an individual
song in a playlist as defined.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-play" data-amplitude-song-index="1" data-amplitude-playlist="test_playlist"></span>
  
----

==== link:#pause-button[#] Pause Button

The pause button has 4 different levels.

. Global Pause - Pauses the active song no matter if it's individual or
in a playlist.
. Playlist Pause - Pauses the active song in the playlist.
. Song Pause - Pauses an individual song.
. Song In Playlist Pause - Pauses an individual song in a playlist.

The pause button responds to the 'click' event on a desktop or a
'touchstart' event on mobile.

===== link:#global-pause[#] Global Pause

The global pause button will pause whatever song is currently playing.
To add a global pause button simply add an HTML element with the class
of 'amplitude-pause'.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-pause"></span>
  
----

===== link:#playlist-pause[#] Playlist Pause

The playlist pause button will pause the active song in the playlist. It
only works if the playlist defined in the attribute is playing the song.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-pause" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist}"></span>
  
----

===== link:#individual-song-pause[#] Individual Song Pause

The individual song pause button will pause the song defined by the
attribute `data-amplitude-song-index="song_index"`.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-pause" data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}"></span>
  
----

===== link:#individual-song-in-playlist-pause[#] Individual Song In Playlist Pause

If you want to pause an individual song in a playlist, you need to add
both the `data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}"` and the
`data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist}"` attributes.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-pause" data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist}"></span>
  
----

==== link:#play-pause-button[#] Play Pause Button

The play/pause button is probably the most common button to be
implemented when working with AmplitudeJS. Depending on the global
state, playlist state and/or song state, this element will get a class
that is `amplitude-playing` or `amplitude-paused` that can be styled
accordingly. It's common to set a play or pause button image as a
background in CSS so when the interaction occurs, the proper button
appears.

There are 3 levels of Play/Pause buttons.

. Global Play/Pause - Plays or pauses the active song no matter if it's
independent or part of a playlist.
. Playlist Play/Pause - Plays or pauses the active song in the scope of
the playlist.
. Song Play/Pause - Plays or pauses an individual song.
. Song In Playlist Play/Pause - Plays or pauses an individual song in
the playlist.

[[global-play-pause]]
===== link:#global-play-pause[#] Global Play/Pause

The global play pause button plays or pauses the current song depending
on the state of the AmplitudeJS player. This button does not account for
whether the song is in a playlist or an individual song, it's whatever
song is active the functionality works on.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-play-pause"></span>
  
----

[[playlist-play-pause]]
===== link:#playlist-play-pause[#] Playlist Play/Pause

The playlist play pause button plays or pauses the current song in a
playlist. If a song is being played outside of a playlist when clicked,
the playlist will play the first song in the playlist assigned to the
button clicked and pause the other song. To add a playlist play pause
button add an element with the class of `amplitude-play-pause` an
attribute of `data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist-index}`.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-play-pause" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist}"></span>
  
----

[[song-play-pause]]
===== link:#song-play-pause[#] Song Play/Pause

The song play pause button plays or pauses an individual song when
clicked.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-play-pause" data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}"></span>
  
----

[[song-in-playlist-play-pause]]
===== link:#song-in-playlist-play-pause[#] Song In Playlist Play/Pause

The song in playlist play pause button plays or pauses an individual
song in a playlist when clicked. This is defined by a combination of the
`data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}"` attributes and the
`data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist}"` attributes.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-play-pause" data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist}"></span>
  
----

==== link:#stop-button[#] Stop Button

There is only one level for the stop button:

. Global - Stops whatever song is playing.

The stop button simply stops the active song. On a desktop, this will
respond to the 'click' event and a 'touchstart' on mobile. To add a stop
button simply add the following HTML element:

===== link:#global-stop-button[#] Global Stop Button

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-stop"></span>
  
----

==== link:#mute-button[#] Mute Button

There is only one level for the mute button:

. Global - Mutes the current song.

The mute button is another global element that mutes the active song. On
a desktop, this element will respond to the 'click' event and a
'touchstart' on mobile. There are two classes that get added to the mute
button so you can style it according to the state of the player.

When the player is not muted the class `amplitude-not-muted` is added to
the element and `amplitude-muted` is added when the player is muted.

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-mute"></span>
  
----

==== link:#volume-up[#] Volume Up

There is only one level for the volume up button:

. Global - Increases the volume by the amount specified on init. Default
5%.

The volume up button increments the volume by the amount defined in the
config. By default the increment is 5. To change the increment you must
adjust the volume_increment setting in the `Amplitude.init()` method.
This element will respond to a `click` on desktop or a `touchstart`
event on mobile. On iPhones, the user can not adjust the volume through
the web page. To add a volume up element add:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-volume-up"></span>
  
----

==== link:#volume-down[#] Volume Down

There is only one level for the volume down button:

. Global - Decreases the volume by the amount specified on init. Default
5%.

The volume down button decrements the volume by the amount defined in
the config. By default the decrement is 5. To change the increment you
must adjust the volume_decrement setting in the `Amplitude.init()`
method. This element will respond to a 'click' on desktop or a
'touchstart' event on mobile. On iPhones, the user can not adjust the
volume through the web page. To add a volume up element add:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-volume-down"></span>
  
----

==== link:#volume-slider[#] Volume Slider

There is only one level for the volume slider:

. Global - Increases or Decreases the volume by sliding the range
element.

The volume slider MUST be an HTML 5 range input element. This allows the
user to slide the volume to where they want. On desktop and mobile, this
element listens to a 'change' or 'input' event. It will not work on
iPhones since iOS doesn't allow the user to adjust the volume through
anything but the volume up and down hardware buttons. To add a volume
slider, add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<input type="range" class="amplitude-volume-slider"/>
  
----

==== link:#next-button[#] Next Button

AmplitudeJS extends functionality for the audio tag by allowing
designers and developers to build playlists. When a next button has been
added AmplitudeJS will go to the next song in the state of the player.

There are two levels of the next button.

. Global Next - Will go to the next song in the state no matter what
state the player is in. If the player is playing a specific playlist,
the global next button will go to the next song in the list.
. Playlist Next - Will go to the next song in the playlist.

The next button will either go sequentially down the indexes or the next
index in the shuffled songs array. If the player is playing a playlist,
then the global next button will operate on that playlist.

===== link:#global-next-button[#] Global Next Button

To add a global next button add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-next"></span>
  
----

===== link:#playlist-next-button[#] Playlist Next Button

To add a playlist next button add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-next" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist_key}"></span>
  
----

The playlist next button has a `data-amplitude-playlist` attribute with
the key for the playlist it's corresponding to.

A quick note on the playlist next buttons. If you have two playlists (A
& B), and you are playing playlist A, but press a next button that is
relating to playlist B, the next button won't do anything.

==== link:#previous-button[#] Previous Button

Similar to the next button, the previous button goes to the previous
song in the state of the player. There are two levels of the previous
button.

. Global Previous - Will go to the previous song in the state no matter
what state the player is in.
. Playlist Previous - Will go to the previous song in the playlist no
matter the state.

The previous button will go sequentially down the indexes or to the
previous index in the shuffled songs array. If the player is playing a
playlist, the global previous button will operate on that playlist.

===== link:#global-previous-button[#] Global Previous Button

To add a global previous button add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-prev"></span>
  
----

===== link:#playlist-previous-button[#] Playlist Previous Button

To add a playlist previous button add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-prev" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist_key}"></span>
  
----

The playlist previous button has a `data-amplitude-playlist` attribute
with the key for the playlist it's corresponding to. Similar to the next
buttons, if you have two playlists and you click a previous button
scoped to the inactive playlist, then it won't do anything.

==== link:#shuffle-button[#] Shuffle Button

The shuffle button has two levels:

. Global Shuffle Button - Shuffles the songs array. This is used outside
the scope of the playlist.
. Playlist Shuffle Button - Shuffles all of the songs in a playlist.
This state is kept on a per-playlist basis.

The shuffle button is also an extension of functionality added by
AmplitudeJS. It allows the developer/user to shuffle songs in a playlist
or on a global level.

Playlists can have shuffle states independent of other playlists. When a
song ends or the user goes to the next song, AmplitudeJS will know
whether or not the playlist should go to the next sequential user
defined song or the next song in the shuffle array. When a playlist is
shuffled or the global songs are shuffled a class of
`amplitude-shuffle-on` is applied to the element where if shuffle is
turned off `ampltiude-shuffle-off` is applied to the element.

===== link:#global-shuffle-button[#] Global Shuffle Button

To add a shuffle button add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-shuffle"></span>
  
----

===== link:#playlist-shuffle-button[#] Playlist Shuffle Button

To add a playlist shuffle button add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-shuffle" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist_key}"></span>
  
----

This shuffle button contains the attribute that defines the playlist
key. This will shuffle only the playlist defined.

==== link:#repeat-button[#] Repeat Button

The repeat button, when active, will repeat the entire songs array when
the last song has been played.

There are two levels to the Repeat Button:

. Global Repeat - Repeats the songs in the songs array when the last
song has finished.
. Playlist Repeat - Repeats the playlist when the last song in the
playlist has finished.

The buttons can be styled based off of the state of the classes applied
to the button. When repeat is not on, the button will have a class of
`amplitude-repeat-off` applied to the element and when repeat is on, the
class `amplitude-repeat-on` applied to the element.

===== link:#global-repeat-button[#] Global Repeat Button

To add the repeat button, add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-repeat"></span>
  
----

===== link:#playlist-repeat-button[#] Playlist Repeat Button

To add a playlist repeat button, add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-repeat" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist_key}"></span>
  
----

==== link:#repeat-song[#] Repeat Song

There is only one level of the repeat song button:

. Global - Repeats the current song when eneded.

The repeat song button, when active, will repeat the individual song
when the song has ended. The button can be styled based off of the sate
of classes applied to the button. When the repeat is not on, the button
will have a class of `amplitude-repeat-song-off` and when on,
`amplitude-repeat-song-on`.

===== link:#global-repeat-song-button[#] Global Repeat Song Button

To add the repeat song button, add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-repeat-song"></span>
  
----

==== link:#playback-speed-button[#] Playback Speed Button

There is only one level for the playback speed button:

. Global - Determines how fast the audio should play back through
AmplitudeJS.

The playback speed button controls how fast the audio is played back
through AmplitudeJS. There are 3 speeds.

. '1.0' which is the base speed.
. '1.5' which is 1.5x as fast
. '2.0' which is 2x as fast

When clicked, the playback speed button will add a class representing
the speed the player is playing back at. The classes can be styled as
well and are as follows:

* '1.0' = 'amplitude-playback-speed-10'
* '1.5' = 'amplitude-playback-speed-15'
* '2.0' = 'amplitude-playback-speed-20'

===== link:#global-playback-speed-button[#] Global Playback Speed Button

To add a playback speed button simply add the following HTML:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-playback-speed"></span>
  
----

==== link:#skip-to-link[#] Skip To Link

There are 2 levels for the skip to link:

. Individual Song - Skips to time defined for a song an individual song
in the songs array.
. Individual Song In Playlist - Skips to a time defined for an
individual song in a playlist.

The skip to links allow the user to define spots in the audio like
bookmarks that can be skipped to. They can reference a song in a
playlist or an individual song depending on the attributes. If you want
to link to a song in a playlist, you have to add the attribute
`data-amplitude-song-index="index"` and
`data-amplitude-playlist="playlist"`. To make the skip work, you will
also have to add an attribute `data-amplitude-location="seconds"` to
link to in the song.

===== link:#individual-song-link[#] Individual Song Link

An example song link would be:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-skip-to" data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}" data-amplitude-location="30"></span>
  
----

This link will go to the song at the index defined and the location of
the seconds defined by the `data-amplitude-location` attribute into the
song.

===== link:#individual-song-in-playlist-link[#] Individual Song In Playlist Link

An example of an individual song in playlist link would be:

[source,language-html]
----
<span class="amplitude-skip-to" data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}" data-amplitude-location="30" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist}"></span>
  
----

This will skip to 30 seconds into a song in the playlist defined.
Remember, the index of the song in the playlist is scoped to the
playlist!

==== link:#song-tracking-slider-html-5-range[#] Song Tracking Slider (HTML 5 Range)

There are 4 levels to the song tracking slider:

. Global - This tracks whatever song is playing.
. Playlist - This tracks the song currently playing in the playlist.
. Individual Song - This tracks an individual song.
. Individual Song In Playlist - This tracks an individual song within a
playlist.

Song tracking sliders are implemented with the HTML 5 range element.
This provides a semantic way to navigate through a song. The HTML 5
range element provides functionality and you can style it, even if it's
a pain. However, if you are motivated, you can implement a custom song
slider using some of the callbacks and public facing methods.

Note that features like the tracking slider and progress bar depend on
the browser being able to request the audio file in arbitrary chunks.
Firefox can work around lack of support from the server, but for these
features to work properly, your server must support

.

===== link:#global-song-slider[#] Global Song Slider

To add a global song slider, add the following element:

[source,language-html]
----
<input type="range" class="amplitude-song-slider" step=".1"/>
  
----

The class name is `amplitude-song-slider`. the `step` attribute makes
fine tuning the slider to react more to the current state of the song
more fluid.

===== link:#playlist-song-slider[#] Playlist Song Slider

If you want to do an individual playlist, you can add the attribute of
`data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist_key}"`.

[source,language-html]
----
<input type="range" class="amplitude-song-slider" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist_key}"/>
  
----

===== link:#individual-song-slider[#] Individual Song Slider

You can also add a song slider for an individual song like this:

[source,language-html]
----
<input type="range" class="amplitude-song-slider" data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}"/>
  
----

===== link:#individual-song-in-playlist-slider[#] Individual Song In Playlist Slider

You can also add a song slider for an individual song in a playlist like
this:

[source,language-html]
----
<input type="range" class="amplitude-song-slider" data-amplitude-playlist="{playlist_key}" data-amplitude-song-index="{song_index}"/>
  
----

==== link:#song-progress-bar[#] Song Progress Bar

There are 4 levels where you can add a song progress bar:

. Global - Displays the current progress for the audio being played.
. Playlist - Displays the current progress if the current song is in the
playlist.
. Individual Song - Displays the current progress for an individual
song.
. Individual Song In Playlist - Displays the individual song current
progress for a song in the playlist.

The song progress bar must be implemented with the HTML 5 progress
element. This allows you full customization over the design. These
operate the same as the range except you will have to implement your own
slider event handling. I wrote a quick tutorial on that here:

==== link:#song-buffered-progress-bar[#] Song Buffered Progress Bar

There are 4 levels for a song buffered progress bar:

. Global - Displays the percentage of the song buffered for the current
song.
. Playlist - Displays the percentage of the song buffered for the
current playlist song.
. Individual Song - Displays the percentage of the song buffered for an
individual song.
. Individual Song In Playlist - Displays the percentage of the song
buffered for an individual song in a playlist.

The Song Buffered Progress Bar has to be an HTML 5 progress element.
This is the proper semantic element for this use case. This allows for a
visual display of how much of the song has been buffered. You can do
some CSS techniques to overlay this progress element over the
song-played-progress element to make an all in one, or you could leave
it by itself.

===== link:#global-song-buffered-progress-bar[#] Global Song Buffered Progress Bar
