[role="dropcap"]
Speak2Me, a speech synthesise module for J1 Template, enables a so-called
Text-To-Speech converter. The converter functionality allows users to sit
back and listen to the browser read aloud the important contents on a web
page.

This page provides typical content elements used for webpages. Run the
converter to experience how those content elements are spoken.

[role="mb-4"]
The converter is started by clicking on the *speaker* symbol
mdi:speaker[24px, md-blue] which is placed top right in the *menu bar*.

[CAUTION]
====
The Speak2Me module is currently only available as an experimental version,
and only base elements are used for speech output. In the case of complex
elements such as tables, images, carousels, or galleries, only information
is spoken.

Browsers from manufacturers such as *Firefox* or Chromium-based browsers
like *Opera* use voices provided by Microsoft but in very poor quality and
are not supported for speech output.

Note that *Text-To-Speech* conversion is *not* available on mobile devices.

// Include sub-documents (if any)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[role="mt-5"]
== Text elements

The most common text elements used are *headlines* and *paragraphs*.

Headings typically represent *titles* and *subtitles* of sections within a
webpage. They provide visual differentiation for your content and play
an important role in accessibility. For example, headings help screen readers
understand the structure of your page and assist in navigation.

Paragraphs are structural elements displayed in a separated *block* element.
However, some elements defined as a paragraph cannot be spoken because of
their complexity.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Structured text

Blocks in webpages that contain structured text refer to specific *sections*
or *elements* of content that are organized and formatted in a structured
manner to improve readability and accessibility. These text blocks are
designed to provide a clear and organized presentation for human users to
understand the discussed context better.

Typical elements are:

* all technical terms
* highlighted text blocks
* embedded code blocks

[role="mt-4"]
==== Technical terms

Technological terms are specialized words or phrases used in a particular
field or domain to describe specific concepts, processes, technologies,
or ideas. These terms are often unique to a specific area of expertise
and may have precise meanings well-understood by professionals and
experts.

Because of current limitations of the synthesise module *Speak2Me*, words
are marked as *specialized* words are *not* spoken.

The following _Rouge_ themes are used for J1 Template (specialized words are
not spoken):

* light theme — based on the Igor theme `igorpro`
* dark theme — based on the Monokai theme `monokai.sublime`

[role="mt-4"]
==== Highlighted text

Text blocks highlighted in webpages refer to sections of text that have
been visually emphasized to stand out from the surrounding content. These
blocks are typically formatted using different styles, such as changing
the background color, applying a border, or using bold or italic fonts to
make them more noticeable and draw attention to important information.

[role="mt-4 mb-5"]

Configuration file: ...

 Incremental build: enabled
      Generating...
     J1 QuickSearch: creating search index ...
     J1 QuickSearch: finished, index ready.
     ....
----

[role="mt-4"]
==== Code blocks

In webpages, a code block refers to a section of code typically enclosed
within special HTML or programming language tags to indicate that the content
inside should be interpreted as code and not regular text. These code blocks
are often used to display and format HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other
programming code snippets on a webpage.

    if(sheets[i].href && sheets[i].href.indexOf(styleSheet) > -1) {
      return true;;
    }
  }
}
----

[role="mt-4"]
==== Quotations

Elements that povide quotations in webpages are used to visually highlight an
excerpt. They are designed to stand out from the regular text and clarify that
the content is from another person, website, or any external source.

Example of a *single* line quote:

"Don't do stupid things twice. The selection is too big for that."
-- Jean-Paul Sartre

Example of a *multiline* line written quote:

[quote, Albert Einstein]
____
What frightens me is not the destructive power of the bomb,
but the explosive power of the human heart for evil.
____

[role="mt-4"]
==== Parallax Quote

To show a more eye-catching quote, a parallax quote can be used.

++++
<div id="banner_home_parallax" class="elevated-z0"></div>
++++

[role="mt-4"]
Parallax quotes are used typically on landing pages to present e.g. the
general idea of a website or can be used as an delimiter element on
webpages.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Ordered text

Headlines and paragraphs are commonly used to structure the content of a
webpage, making it more readable. See such a structure below that is
typically used in larger text like articles, or books.

[role="mt-4"]
==== Chapter One

    Tyrion Lannister stood resolute upon the prow of the majestic vessel,
the Wind's Grace, its timeworn planks creaking beneath his weight.

[role="mt-4"]
===== Section One

    It was a gusty tempest, much like the swirling turmoil that had
beset his life ever since he had been forced to flee the shores of
Westeros.

[role="mt-5"]
== Links

Elements for linking are an essential part of all webpages. They allow users
to navigate between different *pages* and *websites*. In HTML, links are
created by using the anchor tag `<a>`. The anchor tag defines a hyperlink, a
*clickable* element, that takes the user to *another* webpage or a specific
location on the *same* page.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Inline Links

Links are place inline a text are hyperlinks embedded directly within the
content of a paragraph or any other text element on a webpage. Inline links
allow users to navigate to other webpages, resources, or sections of the same
page by clicking on the linked *text* element.

[role="mt-4"]
==== Inline Link Example

All websites created by _Jekyll_ are based on Themes, a template system to
ease the creation process of webpages, design, styles, navigation elements
and more. For a wide range of website types, the
link:{url-jamstack-club--j1-theme}[J1 Theme, {browser-window--new}]
accessible at the Jamstack Club can be used. Check the preview function and,
if the Jekyll Theme meet your needs, you can create a example web from here:
link:{url-j1--rocketstart}[Rocketstart, {browser-window--new}] to create a
site on the Internet in minutes.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Link Block

A *block* of links refers to a section in a webpage containing a collection
of organized hyperlinks. These links lead to different pages, resources, or
external websites. Such blocks are commonly used to present links to point
the reader to related content resources.

[role="mt-4"]
==== Link Block Example

mdi:link-variant[24px, md-gray mr-2 ml-3]
J1 Theme at link:{url-jamstack-club--j1-theme}[Jamstack Club, {browser-window--new}] +

mdi:link-variant[24px, md-gray mr-2 ml-3]
Popular SSGs and Themes at link:{url-jekyll-themes--home}[Jekyll Themes, {browser-window--new}]

[role="mt-5"]
== Information Blocks

Elements for users' information draw the reader to certain statements by
labeling them as priorities displayed in separate blocks. The J1 template
system provides five types shown by the following examples.

[NOTE]
====
Blocks of type *note* give additional details on the currently
discussed topic that may help the reader to understand the following
content better.
====

[TIP]
====
An *Information* block of type *tip* provides facts that may help
the reader *to go further* or points to additional *options* available
that can be used.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Blocks of type *important* provide facts that should be
remembered.
====

[WARNING]
====
Blocks of type *warning* advise readers to act carefully and point to
potential risks or trippings.
====

[CAUTION]
====
A block of type *caution* instructs readers of potential danger,
harm, or consequences for the wrong usage.
====


[role="mt-5"]
== Tables

Elements displayed as tables are used to organize and present data in a
structured format. Tables consist of rows and columns, and they are primarily
used to present tabular data such as technical data and other types of
information that require a grid-like layout.

.Files and Folders
[cols="4a, 8a", width="100%", options="header", role="rtable mt-4"]
|===
|File\|Folder |Description

|`_config.yml`
|Stores all *side-wide* used configuration data. Many of these options can
be specified from the command line executable but it's easier to specify
them in a file so you don't have to remember them.

|`_drafts`
|Drafts are unpublished posts. The format of these files is without a
date: `title.MARKUP`.

|===


[role="mt-5"]
== Lists

List elements are used to organize and present information in a structured
and easily readable format. Those elements are commonly used for creating
navigation menus and content outlines, steps in a process, and various other
scenarios where a structured presentation of information is required.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Unordered list

A unordered list represents a collection of items where the order of the
items is not significant. The list elements are typically displayed with
bullet points, or other marker symbols, preceding each item.

An unordered list may look-alike:

* _Windows_, _Linux_ and _MacOS_ platforms supported
* _Jekyll_ v4 Support and _Ruby_ v3 Support
* Asciidoc and Markdown Support

[role="mt-4"]
=== Ordered list

A ordered list is a way to present a list of items in a specific order,
where each item is preceded by a sequential number or letter. It's often
used when you want to display information step-by-step or hierarchically.

Here's an example of how an ordered list is displayed:

. _Bootstrap_ extensions included
. _Asciidoctor_ extensions included
. Infinite Scoll Support

[role="mt-4"]
=== Definition list

A definition list is a element used to create a list of terms and their
corresponding definitions. It typically present a glossary, a set of
key-value pairs, or any situation where you have to associate terms with
their explanations.

[role="mt-4"]
Performance::
One of the main advantages of using a static site is that it is unbelievably
fast to load. When the user requests a page, there is no need to request
a database to generate the page itself. All the content is already placed
in one HTML file.

Security::
Say goodbye to hacking and security issues issued every week. A static site
has no database or other complex underlying interdependent parts. Indeed,
your site will have fewer footprints and security issues since it
only loads plain HTML files.

[role="mt-5"]
== Images

There are two general types of image used on webpages: block and inline
images.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Inline image

An image placed *inline* is displayed in the flow of another element, such
as a paragraph block.

[role="mt-4"]
image:{{page.book.cover}}[height=480, role="mr-4 mb-2 float-left"]

His working life has been defined by questions. *Why is this bastard
lying to me?* was at the front of his mind as he conducted every interview.
But it wasn't just politicians. Paxman's interviews with Dizzee Rascal,
David Bowie, Russell Brand, Vivienne Westwood are legendary.

He discussed belief with religious leaders and philosophers, economics
with CEOs and bankers, books with writers and art and theatre with artists.

After 22 years on University Challenge, Paxman is also the longest-serving
active quizmaster on British television. Now, in these long-awaited memoirs,
he spills the beans behind four decades in front of the camera.

He offers reflections and stories from a career that has taken him as a
reporter to many of the world's war zones and trouble spots - Central America,
Beirut, Belfast, to the studios of Tonight, Panorama, Breakfast Time, the
Six O'clock News. Filled with candid stories about the great, the good and
the rotters that have crossed his path, his memoirs are as magnetic to read
as Paxman is to watch.
In that book, Paxman tells some terrific stories and laughs at much of the
silliness in the world. A Life in Questions charts the life of the greatest
political interviewer of our time.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Block image

A *block* image is displayed as a *discrete* element on its own line in a
document. Webpages use block images for various purposes to enhance
visual appeal, convey information, and improve the overall user experience.

image::/assets/image/page/panels/responsive-text-1920x800.jpg[{{page.title}}, width=1280, role="mb-4"]

[role="mt-4 mb-5"]
[NOTE]
====
Carefully chosen and well-placed images can significantly enhance the overall
effectiveness of a webpage.
====

[role="mt-4"]
[#lightbox2]
== Lightbox

Lightboxes are UI elements commonly used in webpages for various purposes.
They serve as a way to display content or interact with users without
requiring them to navigate away from the current page. This UI element
is typically designed to grab the user's attention and provide a focused
interaction experience.

[role="mb-4"]
Find below an example of using the default lightbox of the J1 Template
to display and enlarge an group of images.

.Lightbox block for multiple images
lightbox::example-group[ 395, {data-images-group}, group, role="mb-4 wm-800" ]


[role="mt-5"]
== Carousel

Standard carousels for J1 Template are based on OWL Carousel *V1* in the
latest version. This carousel is a clean and neat _jQuery_ slider plugin
for creating fully responsive and touch-enabled carousels.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Text Carousel

[role="mb-4"]
A carousel is typically used for displaying images. The implementation for
the J1 Template supports a lot more sources to be used for a slide show:
simple text, for example.

.Simple text
carousel::demo_text_carousel[role="mb-4"]

Important statements or topics can be placed on top of an article or a
paragraph to give them better visibility. In one line, you can present
many facts to know animated for the reader's attention within a single
line. No much space is needed!

[role="mt-4"]
=== Parallax text

A more eye-minded type of text-based slide show is a parallax text slider.
If you want to emphasize your statements focussing the meaning, this kind
of a slide show may be interesting. Image-based slide shows may draw off
the reader's attention from the text, therefore a pure text-based presentation
maybe the better choice.

.Parallax effect
carousel::demo_text_carousel_parallax[role="mb-4"]

[role="mt-4"]
=== Image Carousel

Carousels are mostly used for pictures data to animate the images as a series.
Find with the following some examples of how to use a carousel for your image
data.

A image carousel typically consists of a container with images and a navigation
system, including buttons, arrows, or dots that allow users to move back and
forth between images or select a specific image.

Image carousels can also include animation effects, such as fade-in or
slide-in transitions between images, to make the presentation more visually
appealing.

.Image Carousel
slick::image_carousel_full[role="mb-5"]

[role="mt-4"]
=== Carousel from Collections

[role="mb-4"]
A carousel from a collection for J1 Template is a *pre-defined* carousel
type to display collection *articles* on a webpage as a carousel. Collection
carousels pull content from a specific *collection*. All Carousels for
collections display the article image and a link to the article as a
caption. All carousels for the J1 Template can be easily customized in
various ways, such as changing the slider speed, or the navigation options
like *Arrows* and *Dots*.

.Collection Biography
slick::collection_carousel_biography[role="mb-5"]


[role="mt-4"]
== Slider

The tool _Masterslider_ is a Query plugin fully integrated into the J1
Template. JekyllOne uses the *free* version of Masterslider well-known as
*MS Lite*. The lite version does *not* support all features of the *full*
product. The functionality of *filters*, *layouts* are limited and *no*
overlay techniques are supported by the MS Lite version.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Slider using Thumbs

To give the users better control over a slideshow, sliders provide complex UI
elements like *thumbs* placed side-by-side left or right, or at the bottom
of a slideshow. Find two examples below how to control a slideshow.

.Image controls
masterslider::ms_00004[role="mb-5"]

.Text controls
masterslider::ms_00007[role="mt-4 mb-5"]


[role="mt-5"]
== Galleries

The J1 module link:{url-justified-gallery--home}[JustifiedGallery, {browser-window--new}]
is a great tool to create responsive and high-quality *justified* image
galleries. JekyllOne combines the gallery with a lightbox to enlarge the
images of a gallery. See the gallery in action. And for sure, all what you
see is even *responsive*.

[role="mt-4"]
[TIP]
====
Change the size of your current browser width to see what will happen!
====

.Masonry grid Gallery
gallery::jg_old_times[role="mb-5"]


[role="mt-5"]
== Masonry Grid

The J1 Masonry module is a great tool to create dynamic image galleries.
Image galleries are popular on many websites, and masonry can be a useful
tool for creating dynamic and visually appealing galleries.

[role="mb-5"]
[TIP]
====
Change the size of your current browser width to see what will happen!
====

.Image Cards
masonry::image_fixed_height_lb[]

[role="mt-4"]
By using masonry, you can create a gallery that displays images of different
sizes in an aesthetically pleasing and functional way.


[role="mt-5"]
== Audio Players

Audio players can be embedded in webpages very easy by using the HTML5 audio
tag `<audio>`. Browsers have a built-in multimedia framework for decoding
and playing audio content directly within a webpage.

.Ambient Piano
audio::/assets/audio/sound-effects/ambient-piano.mp3[role="mt-4 mb-5"]


[role="mt-4"]
== Video Players

Players for videos to be embedded in webpages are software components that
integrate and play videos directly within a webpage or application. These
players are essential for websites, blogs, and apps that want to display video
content without requiring users to download the video file or use any external
media player.

Embedded video players provide a seamless and user-friendly way to present
video content to your audience.

[role="mt-4"]
=== HTML5

HTML5 Video opens the doors to your way of presenting video content. All
modern browsers support the video tag `<video>` for the HTML5. Browsers have
a built-in multimedia framework already for decoding and displaying video
content. No need to use such proprietary software components anymore.

.HTML5 Player
video::/assets/video/gallery/html5/video1.mp4[poster="/assets/video/gallery/video1-poster.jpg" role="mt-4 mb-5"]

[role="mt-4"]
=== VideoJS

VideoJS is an Open Source JavaScript framework and library for building
custom video players for the web. It provides a flexible and customizable
platform for displaying and controlling video content on websites and web
applications.

=== Wistia

Wistia is a marketing software and video hosting platform made for B2B
marketers with free or paid plans. While Wistia may not be the
*Big Man on Campus* like Vimeo, it still brings valuable functionality
to the table for marketers and should be seriously considered as a viable
video platform.

.Wistia Video
wistia::29b0fbf547[role="mt-5 mb-4"]

[role="mt-5"]
=== Vimeo

Vimeo is an online video-sharing platform that allows users to upload,
share, and view videos. It was founded in 2004 by a group of filmmakers
and has since grown into a popular platform for individuals and businesses
to showcase their videos. Vimeo is known for its emphasis on high-quality
video content, creative expression, and a supportive community of creators.
