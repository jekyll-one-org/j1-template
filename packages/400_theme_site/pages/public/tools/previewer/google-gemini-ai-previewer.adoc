The Google Gemini platform provides an AI-based ChatBot system (formerly *Bard*)
based on a family of so-called large language models (LLMs) developed by
Google AI, announced in December 2023. The LLMs of Gemini are the successors
to LaMDA and PaLM 2, positioning itself as a competitor to OpenAIs' ChatGPT
for the current version of *GPT-4*.

Searching the Internet today typically requires multiple search engine requests
for proper results. Modern AI-based Chatbots can simplify an Internet search
to a single request by asking a Bot.

== Technology (February 2024)

Like OpenAI's competing product, ChatGPT, Google Gemini can answer questions
conversationally. Gemini allows multimodal work, which means you can enter
various media, such as voice or photos, and have different formats, such as
code or language output. However, Gemini is currently unlike ChatGPT, unable
to *create images*.

The chatbot was initially developed based on the Large Language Model LaMDA
before using the better model PaLM 2 from May 2023 and the newly developed
*LLM Gemini* of the same name since December 2023. The Gemini-based version
of the Chatbot system is available in over 230 countries and supports
currently 40 languages.

Unlike ChatGPT 4, Google Gemini is *free* to use, but a paid version is also
available called _Gemini Advanced_. However, Google itself points out that
the tool still has weaknesses. At the beginning of the release, Google
described _Bard_ as an experiment, but with the rebranding as Gemini, it is
not longer in a experimental state.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Official Gemini Chatbot App

The *official* Chatbot version from Google Gemini is available at
link://gemini.google.com/app[Google Gemini App, {browser-window--new}]
including the *EU* region. Note that for using the Chatbot App, it is required
to be logged in at Google - using your GMail account for example. Find more on
the *privacy protection* settings using at the
link:https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?visit_id=638438812942129559-1947527328&p=privacy_help&rd=1#config_settings[Gemini Apps Privacy Hub, {browser-window--new}].


[role="mt-5"]
== Supported regions

Following its initial launch in the United States, Google's next-generation
AI assistant Gemini is now available in select regions across Latin America,
Africa, Asia Pacific, and Canada. Find more details on where you can use
link:{url-google--gemini-regions-en}[Google Gemini, {browser-window--new}].

Note that Google Gemini is currently *not supported* for the *EU* and some
other regions. Google Gemini is a personalized advertising solution that uses
cookies and other tracking technologies to make advertising more relevant.
However, this may violate EU data protection laws that govern companies
prohibit the use of personal data without the express consent of the to
collect user information.

[role="mt-3 mb-4"]
[NOTE]
====
Google is working on making the App's and API's on the Gemini platform
compliant with *GDPR* for the EU region. However, it is not clear when this
will happen.
====

Gemini requires collecting personal information, such as IP addresses and
device identifiers, which are only collected with the user's consent in the
EU. The lack of support for Google Gemini in the EU region has essentially
the following reasons:

Privacy Policys::
Google Gemini is a tool that enables display ad targeting across multiple
platforms, which requires collecting and sharing data about user's
online activities. The EU has strict data protection regulations that make
it difficult for companies to process data and collect and share user
information. These provisions make it difficult for Google to operate
Google Gemini in the EU.

Competition law regulations::
Google's Gemini could allow the company to gain a dominant position in the
digital advertising market. The EU has a competition law. Some regulations
prohibit companies from establishing their dominant position which may in the
EU conflict with these provisions.


[role="mt-5"]
== Use out of supported regions

With the help of a virtual private network (VPN), you can use webpages using
the Google *Gemini API* in regions that are currently *not supported*.
VPN's hide the user's actual IP address. Instead, a new IP address that comes
from a selectable region, for example, the USA, will be used.

A virtual private network is a private network that is built and operated over
a public network such as the Internet. VPN's allow users to establish secure
connections to other networks over the Internet. They can be used to provide
access to geographically restricted websites and services, improve privacy,
and security.

Common features of VPN's:

Traffic Encryption::
VPN's encrypt all traffic sent and received over the network. Encryption
prevents third parties, such as Internet service providers or hackers,
from accessing and reading the data. Encryption, therefore, ensures that
the privacy of users is protected.

Hiding the IP address::
VPN's hide the user's actual IP address. Instead, a new IP address belonging
to the VPN provider is used. Third parties can no longer determine the user's
location or track them based on their IP address, which protects their
privacy.

Access restricted content::
Many VPN's allow users to access blocked content in their country or region
because a VPN hide the user's true IP address, allowing them to access content
unavailable in their country or region.

.Privacy
[NOTE]
====
Using Google Gemini outside supported regions via a VPN, your privacy is
protected and no *real* user information is used or transferred to the
service.

[role="mt-5"]
== VPN Clients on Windows

Several VPN clients on Windows are available that can be used for free.

VPN Clients providing a *free plan*:

* link://windscribe.com/[Windscribe VPN, {browser-window--new}],
  Offers AES-256 encryption and secure browsing features.
* link://protonvpn.com/[Proton VPN, {browser-window--new}],
  Focuses on privacy and offers secure OpenVPN connections. ProtonVPN
  offers a usable *free* plan and *premium* plans for more options
  as well.
* link://tunnelbear.com/[TunnelBear VPN, {browser-window--new}],
  Provides a user-friendly interface and unlimited data
  for free users.

[role="mt-4"]
.Build-in VPN
[TIP]
=====
Some computer *security applications* like link://avast.com/[Avast, {browser-window--new}]
provide for *paid plans* a VPN solution *build-in*. You should check if a VPN
client is already availabe for the security application you'e using.
=====

I've tested the VPN client _TunnelBear VPN_ on Windows with success. The
limitation I found is the *amount* of *data* transferred over the VPN gateway.
The limit is *2GB* for the *free* version, but should be enough for testing
Google Gemini.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Setting up TunnelBear VPN

Setting up TunnelBear VPN is a simple three step procedure. First, subscribe
at link://tunnelbear.com/[TunnelBear VPN, {browser-window--new}] and install
the product:

.Subscribe at TunnelBear VPN
lightbox::tunnelbear-subscribe[1280, {data-image-tunnelbear--subscribe}, role="mt-4 mb-4"]

.Verify your email address
lightbox:::tunnelbear-verify-email-address[1280, {data-image-tunnelbear--verify-email-address}, role="mt-4 mb-4"]

.Set the VPN Gateway
lightbox::tunnelbear-set-vpn-gateway[1280, {data-image-tunnelbear--set-vpn-gateway}, role="mt-4 mb-4"]

If _TunnelBear VPN_ is setting up and running successfully using a *supported*
region for the *VPN Gateway*, you can start testing Google Gemini out of any
region you are located.


[role="mt-5"]
== Ask the Bot

The _Google Gemini_ platform provides a *ChatBot* system using a significant
advancement in the field of LLMs. The ability to process information from
multiple sources, text and images, and its flexible architecture makes it
a powerful tool for many applications and websites.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Example Prompts

Find examples of what can be used for a prompt below. AI-based chatbots can
do much more than an internet search. Let the bot write a *bedtime story*,
let them do a *translation*, or help to *summarize* a larger text. Furthermore,
a bot can support you in evaluating or making requests for guidance.

Copy and paste one of the examples to be used as a prompt. Go for
<<Ask the Bot>> to see the response of the bot.

quantum computing uses specialized hardware to leverage this behavior.

The operating principles of quantum devices is beyond the scope of classical
physics. When deployed at scale, quantum computers could be used in a wide
variety of applications such as: in cybersecurity to break existing encryption
methods while helping researchers create new ones, in meteorology to develop
better weather forecasting etc. However, the current state of the art quantum
computers are still largely experimental and impractical.
