[role="dropcap"]
Speak2Me, a speech synthesise module for J1 Template, enables a so-called
Text-To-Speech converter. The converter functionality allows users to sit
back and listen to the browser read aloud the important contents on a
Web page.

This page provides typical content elements used for web pages. Run the
converter to experience how those content elements are spoken.

The converter is started by clicking on the *speaker* symbol
mdi:speaker[24px, md-blue] which is placed top right in the *menu bar*.

IMPORTANT: The Speak2Me module is currently only available as an experimental
version, and only base elements for designing websites are used for
speech output. In the case of complex elements such as tables, images,
carousels, or galleries, only information texts are spoken.

The *quality* of the *voice output* depends heavily on the web browser
used. Depending on the browser, different voices are provided for the
outputs, which differ *significantly* in their quality. _Google_'s
browser *Chrome* delivers acceptable results. However, the best results
are provided by _Microsoft_ with the browser *Edge*.

CAUTION: The Speak2Me module is currently *not* supported on mobile
devices.

Browsers from other manufacturers, such as Firefox, usually use
voices provided by Microsoft free of charge. However, the quality of the
outputs cannot be compared to those offered by Microsoft Edge. Other
Chromium-based browsers, such as the *Opera* browser, provide voices of a
very poor quality and cannot be recommended for voice output.

IMPORTANT: Errors in the speech output can occur, especially with
content previously translated.

[role="mt-5"]
== Text elements

The most common text elements used are *headlines* and *paragraphs*.

Headings typically represent *titles* and *subtitles* of sections within a
webpage. They provide visual differentiation for your content and play
an important role in accessibility. For example, headings help screen readers
understand the structure of your page and assist in navigation.

Paragraphs are structural elements displayed in a separated *block* element.
However, some elements defined as a paragraph cannot be spoken because of
their complexity.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Structured text

Blocks in web pages that contain structured text refer to specific *sections*
or *elements* of content that are organized and formatted in a structured
manner to improve readability and accessibility. These text blocks are
designed to provide a clear and organized presentation for human users to
understand the discussed context better.

Typical elements are:

* all technical terms
* highlighted text blocks
* embedded code blocks

==== Technical terms

Technological terms are specialized words or phrases used in a particular
field or domain to describe specific concepts, processes, technologies,
or ideas. These terms are often unique to a specific area of expertise
and may have precise meanings well-understood by professionals and
experts.

Because of current limitations of the synthesise module *Speak2Me*, words
are marked as *specialized* words are *not* spoken.

The following _Rouge_ themes are used for J1 Template:

* light theme -- based on the Igor theme `igorpro`
* dark theme -- based on the Monokai theme `monokai.sublime`

==== Highlighted text

Text blocks highlighted in web pages refer to sections of text that have
been visually emphasized to stand out from the surrounding content. These
blocks are typically formatted using different styles, such as changing
the background color, applying a border, or using bold or italic fonts to
make them more noticeable and draw attention to important information.

.Output example
----
Startup the site ..
Configuration file: ...

 Incremental build: enabled
      Generating...
     J1 QuickSearch: creating search index ...
     J1 QuickSearch: finished, index ready.
     ....
----

[role="mt-4"]
==== Code blocks

In web pages, a code block refers to a section of code typically enclosed
within special HTML or programming language tags to indicate that the content
inside should be interpreted as code and not regular text. These code blocks
are often used to display and format HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or other
programming code snippets on a webpage.

    if(sheets[i].href && sheets[i].href.indexOf(styleSheet) > -1) {
      return true;;
    }
  }
}
----

[role="mt-4"]
==== Quotations

Quotations in web pages are used to visually highlight an excerpt. They
are designed to stand out from the regular text and clarify that the
content is from another person, website, or any external source.

[quote, Jean-Paul Sartre]
____
Don't do stupid things twice. The selection is too big for that.
____


[role="mt-4"]
=== Ordered text

Headlines and paragraphs are commonly used to structure the content of a
web page, making it more readable. See such a structure below that is
typically used in larger text like articles, or books.

==== Chapter One

    Tyrion Lannister stood resolute upon the prow of the majestic vessel,
the Wind's Grace, its timeworn planks creaking beneath his weight.

===== Section One

    It was a gusty tempest, much like the swirling turmoil that had
beset his life ever since he had been forced to flee the shores of
Westeros.


[role="mt-5"]
== Information elements

Information blocks draw the reader to certain statements by labeling them
as priorities displayed in separate blocks. The J1 template system provides
five types shown by the following examples.

NOTE: Blocks of type *note* give additional details on the currently
discussed topic that may help the reader to understand the following
content better.

TIP: An *Information* block of type *tip* provides facts that may help
the reader *to go further* or points to additional *options* available
that can be used.

IMPORTANT: Blocks of type *important* provide facts that should be
remembered.

WARNING: A block of type *warning* instructs readers of potential danger,
harm, or consequences for the wrong usage.

CAUTION: *Information* blocks of type *caution* advise readers to act
carefully and point to potential risks or trippings.


[role="mt-5"]
== Tables

Table elements are used to organize and display data in a structured format.
Tables consist of rows and columns, and they are primarily used to present
tabular data such as technical data and other types of information that
require a grid-like layout.

.Files and Folders
[cols="4a,8a", width="100%", options="header", role="rtable mt-4"]
|===
|File\|Folder |Description

|`_config.yml`
|Stores all *side-wide* used configuration data. Many of these options can
be specified from the command line executable but it's easier to specify
them in a file so you don't have to remember them.

|`_drafts`
|Drafts are unpublished posts. The format of these files is without a
date: `title.MARKUP`.

|===


[role="mt-5"]
== Lists

Lists are used to organize and present information in a structured and
easily readable format. The element is commonly used for creating navigation
menus and content outlines, steps in a process, and various other scenarios
where a structured presentation of information is required.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Unordered list

An unordered list represents a collection of items where the order of the
items is not significant. The list elements are typically displayed with
bullet points, or other marker symbols, preceding each item.

An unordered list may look-alike:

* _Windows_, _Linux_ and _MacOS_ platforms supported
* _Jekyll_ v4 Support and _Ruby_ v3 Support
* Asciidoc and Markdown Support

[role="mt-4"]
=== Ordered list

An ordered list is a way to present a list of items in a specific order,
where each item is preceded by a sequential number or letter. It's often
used when you want to display information step-by-step or hierarchically.

Here's an example of how an ordered list is displayed:

. _Bootstrap_ extensions included
. _Asciidoctor_ extensions included
. Infinite Scoll Support

[role="mt-4"]
=== Definition list

A definition list is a element used to create a list of terms and their
corresponding definitions. It typically present a glossary, a set of
key-value pairs, or any situation where you must associate terms with
their explanations.

[role="mt-4"]
Performance::
One of the main advantages of using a static site is that it is unbelievably
fast to load. When the user requests a page, there is no need to request
a database to generate the page itself. All the content is already placed
in one HTML file.

Security::
Say goodbye to hacking and security issues issued every week. A static site
has no database or other complex underlying interdependent parts. Indeed,
your site will have fewer footprints and security issues since it
only loads plain HTML files.

[role="mt-5"]
== Images

There are two general image types used on web pages: block and inline
images.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Inline image

An inline image is displayed in the flow of another element, such as a
paragraph block.

[role="mt-4"]
image:{{page.book.cover}}[height=480, role="mr-4 mb-2 float-left"]

His working life has been defined by questions. *Why is this bastard
lying to me?* was at the front of his mind as he conducted every interview.
But it wasn't just politicians. Paxman's interviews with Dizzee Rascal,
David Bowie, Russell Brand, Vivienne Westwood are legendary.

He discussed belief with religious leaders and philosophers, economics
with CEOs and bankers, books with writers and art and theatre with artists.

After 22 years on University Challenge, Paxman is also the longest-serving
active quizmaster on British television. Now, in these long-awaited memoirs,
he spills the beans behind four decades in front of the camera.

He offers reflections and stories from a career that has taken him as a
reporter to many of the world's war zones and trouble spots - Central America,
Beirut, Belfast, to the studios of Tonight, Panorama, Breakfast Time, the
Six O'clock News. Filled with candid stories about the great, the good and
the rotters that have crossed his path, his memoirs are as magnetic to read
as Paxman is to watch.
In that book, Paxman tells some terrific stories and laughs at much of the
silliness in the world. A Life in Questions charts the life of the greatest
political interviewer of our time.


[role="mt-4"]
=== Block image

A block image is displayed as a discrete element on its own line in a
document. Web pages use block images for various purposes to enhance
visual appeal, convey information, and improve the overall user
experience.

image::/assets/images/pages/panels/responsive-text-1920x800.jpg[{{page.title}}, width=1280, role="mb-4"]

NOTE: Carefully chosen and well-placed images can significantly enhance
the overall effectiveness of a web page.

[role="mt-4"]
[#lightbox2]
== Lightbox

Lightboxes are UI elements commonly used in web pages for various purposes.
They serve as a way to display content or interact with users without
requiring them to navigate away from the current page. This UI element
is typically designed to grab the user's attention and provide a focused
interaction experience.

[role="mb-4"]
Find below an example of using the default lightbox of the J1 Template
to display and enlarge an group of images.

.Lightbox block for multiple images
lightbox::example-group[ 395, {data-images-group}, group, role="mb-4 wm-800" ]


[role="mt-5"]
== Carousel

Standard carousels dor J1 Template are based on OWL Carousel *V1* in the
latest version. OWL Carousel is a clean and neat _jQuery_ slider plugin for
creating fully responsive and touch-enabled carousels.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Text Carousel

[role="mb-4"]
A carousel is typically used for displaying images. The implementation for
the J1 Template supports a lot more sources to be used for a slide show:
simple text, for example.

.Simple text
carousel::demo_text_carousel[role="mb-4"]

Important statements or topics can be placed on top of an article or
a paragraph to give them better visibility. In one line, you can present
many facts to know animated for the reader's attention within a single
line. No much space is needed!

[role="mt-4"]
=== Parallax text

A more eye-minded type of text-based slide show is a parallax text slider. If
you want to emphasize your statements focussing the meaning, this kind of a
slide show may be interesting. Image-based slide shows may draw off the
reader's attention from the text, therefore a pure text-based presentation
maybe the better choice.

.Parallax effect
carousel::demo_text_carousel_parallax[role="mb-4"]

[role="mt-4"]
=== Image Carousel

Carousels are mostly used for pictures data to animate the images as a series.
Find with the following some examples of how to use a carousel for your image
data.

A image carousel typically consists of a container with images and a navigation
system, including buttons, arrows, or dots that allow users to move back and
forth between images or select a specific image.

Image carousels can also include animation effects, such as fade-in or
slide-in transitions between images, to make the presentation more visually
appealing.

.Image Carousel
slick::image_carousel_full[role="mb-5"]

[role="mt-4"]
=== Carousel from Collections

[role="mb-4"]
A carousel from a collection for J1 Template is a *pre-defined* carousel
type to display collection *articles* on a webpage as a carousel. Collection
carousels pull content from a specific *collection*. All Carousels for
collections display the article image and a link to the article as a
caption. All carousels for the J1 Template can be easily customized in
various ways, such as changing the slider speed, or the navigation options
like *Arrows* and *Dots*.

.Collection Biography
slick::collection_carousel_biography[role="mb-5"]


[role="mt-4"]
== Slider

_Masterslider_ is a Query plugin fully integrated into the J1 Template.
Jekyll One uses the *free* version of Masterslider well-known as *MS Lite*.
The lite version does *not* support all features of the *full* product.
The functionality of *filters*, *layouts* are limited and *no* overlay
techniques are supported by the MS Lite version.

[role="mt-4"]
=== Slider using Thumbs

To give the users better control over a slideshow, sliders provide complex UI
elements like *thumbs* placed side-by-side leftor right at the top, or at
the bottom of a slideshow. Find two examples to control a slideshow by
*thumb images*.

.ThumbImage controls
masterslider::ms_00004[role="mb-5"]

.ThumbInfo controls
masterslider::ms_00007[role="mb-5"]


[role="mt-5"]
== Galleries

link:{url-justified-gallery--home}[JustifiedGallery, {browser-window--new}]
is a great _jQuery_ Plugin to create responsive and high-quality justified
image galleries. J1 Template combines the Gallery with the lightboxes
supported to enlarge the images of a gallery. See the gallery in action; and
for sure, all that you see is even responsive. Change the size of your current
browser window, by width or height to see what will happen!

.Masonry grid Gallery
gallery::jg_customizer[role="mb-5"]
