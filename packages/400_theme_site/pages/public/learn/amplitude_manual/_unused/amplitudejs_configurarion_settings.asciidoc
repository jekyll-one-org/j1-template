== Configuring Amplitude

Amplitude JS contains many variables that can be configured to determine
the functionality of AmplitudeJS.

These are set and passed in during the Amplitude.init() method or by the
appropriate public facing method discussed in the `Public Functions`
part of the documentation.

Don't worry, this is just an overview of the different options. We will
be diving deeper into what each of these do throughout the docs.
